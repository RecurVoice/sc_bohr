                <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
                <br>
                Privacy is very important for us.
                <br>
                <br>
                Information Collection and Use
                <br>
                Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a Bohr account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.
                Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you.  If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.
                Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer s hard disk. Bohr may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
                Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Bohr account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Bohr button or widget. Bohr uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.
                Third-Parties: Bohr uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in Bohr account settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads.
                Information Sharing and Disclosure
                <br>
                <br>
                Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Bohr account.
                Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
                Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Bohr s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party s, including a government s, request to disclose your information.
                Business Transfers: In the event that Bohr is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
                Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).
                Modifying Your Personal Information
                <br>
                You can also permanently delete your Bohr account. If you mail hello@bohr.ac, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Bohr.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.
                <br>
                EU Safe Harbor Framework
                Bohr complies with the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce website.
                Changes to this Policy
                We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at bohr.ac/privacypolicy If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @@Bohr_research update or email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
